-- Exercise 7 Exercising using joins, Couldn't add the column where I printed the value of it afterwards, maybe I should make a new table but didn't do that.

INNER JOIN invoices
ON vendors.vendor_id = invoices.invoice_id

ADD invoice_account_total INT NOT NULL;

UPDATE vendors
SET invoice_account_total = ((invoice_total + payment_total))
WHERE vendor_name = 'US Postal Service'*/
